is to build out basics first (MVP), then build out
features from there.

TODO
Helpers to gather info on:
 - Coin prices/volumes traded on different exchanges
 - Internet traffic relating to coins
 - Stock market trends (S&P -> effect on crypto)

Decision (per coin):
 - Volume to buy
 - Volume to hold (majority of time)
 - Volume to Sell (and volume to sell)
